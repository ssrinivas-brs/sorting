## Bubble Sort

The bubbleSort function implements the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the elements of the **arr** array in ascending order. It repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the array is sorted. The noSwaps variable is used to optimize the algorithm by breaking the loop early if no swaps are made during a pass, indicating that the array is already sorted.

The function returns the sorted arr. Bubble Sort is easy to understand but generally less efficient than more advanced sorting algorithms for large datasets.
