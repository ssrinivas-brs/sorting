## Merge Sort

The merge function takes two sorted arrays, array1 and array2, and merges them into a single sorted array called combined. It uses two pointers i and j to iterate through both arrays and compare elements to determine the order in which they should be merged. The mergeSort function is a recursive implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm. It recursively divides the input array arr into smaller halves until it reaches the base case of an array with one or zero elements.

Then, it uses the merge function to combine and sort the divided arrays. The final sorted array is returned. Merge Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n log n) in the average and worst cases.
